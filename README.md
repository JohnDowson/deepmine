The goal of the mod is to enhance sub-surface gameplay and make it worthwhile to build structures and explore deep below the surface. Personally I find the surface (placer) mining mechanic of the game to be the weakest gameplay loop in an otherwise amazing game. I'm striving to make mining in Stationeers a more enjoyable experience :-)

I want to emphasize this mod is very very raw. An alpha version of sorts. I'm hoping to get some feedback from the community on balancing and requested features!

Completed features
 - Lowered bedrock depth (currently 4x deeper)
 - Increasing ore yields the deeper you go
 - Faster drilling speeds

Planned features
 - Increasing vein size/frequency at deeper depths (conversely, sparse veins at the surface)
 - More mining drill tiers. Including tools with larger mining radius.
 - Threats and dangers below the surface. Gas pockets, and various pressure/temperature

Compatibility
 - Not sure about this one, but I'd be hesitant to run this mod with any other terrain generation/ore rebalancing mods.

Installation
 - Requires an installation of BepInEx
 - Once BepInEx is installed (a la pasting in the Stationeers root directory and running the game once), place the provided .dll in the BepInEx\plugins folder

Also - I'm reaching out to any modders who are interested in the project. If you have any experience with BepInex + Harmony patching, and especially use of Harmony Transpiler, please DM me :-)
